# AI-chatbot

## project

Chat-GPT wasn't nice enough to chat with so i made a local chatbot with RAG and webscraping out of boredom 

this chatbot can scrape data from the fandom wiki for animes etc etc

the end project should be something nice that the bot knows from the context where the whole chat takes place and that the character answers like the character in the story.
